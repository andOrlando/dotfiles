<h3>It's my dotfiles</h3>
but only the important ones

I mostly wanna flex my awesome and neovim configuration

It's not actually super portable since I've never had to 
move computers, but this is in preparation to possibly 
eventually someday having to move computers so in time it 
may be made semi-portable. It'll probably never not support 
true color though because I like that too much

all the coolest stuff is done in awesome/deco
